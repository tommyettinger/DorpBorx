Tips and advanced topics:

Be sure to take advantage of your natural recovery. Press 'w5'
or 'w.' to wait in place until you've recovered.

Damage:

Damage values are described as die rolls. For instance, a 2d6
attack will deal damage equal to two dice with six sides each,
added together.

Stealth:

Several factors determine whether you'll be spotted on a given
turn: Your stealth skill, your distance from enemies, whether
you're in darkness or light, and how long you've been within the
sight range of enemies. 

Here's the formula:
Skill * Distance * 10  -  TurnsVisible * 5
The result is your chance to remain unnoticed, in percentage.
(100 and above will always succeed.)
Darkness gives a +2 bonus to stealth skill in this calculation.
Animals are harder to sneak past - they use a 5 instead of 10 in
the formula.

Because of this, you're much more likely to remain unseen
if you stay two or more spaces away. Enemies automatically see
you if you're carrying a light source.
