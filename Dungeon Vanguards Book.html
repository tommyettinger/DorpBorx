<P CLASS="western">	&quot;Well, what now, O wise leader?&quot; Tandar
sneered at Sabharum. &quot;We were cavorting down hallways with not
one monster in sight, and then a dozen statues started chasing us!&quot;
&quot;And so we are faced with a crossroads, with a wall of golems
amassed behind us, and two paths left to take...&quot; Sabhuram sat
and pondered the uncertain corridors leading deeper into this
Crawling Dungeon. &quot;Let us ask the caravaners.&quot; Tandar
rolled his eyes. &quot;Oh, yes, bringing along a tailor and a
fortuneteller was a great idea for a dip into sheer peril.&quot; With
that, Tsuko slapped Tandar on the head. &quot;It would be unseemly
for my special suit to be damaged in battle. As a yakuza, I go into
dangerous situations, and I must be accompanied by a tailor to care
for my garments.&quot; Tandar shook his head and walked over to the
caravan. &quot;Hey, I don't suppose one of you's got a crystal ball
that can see the future back here?&quot; Ombogi stepped up eagerly
and said, &quot;No! But I have the next best thing!&quot; He pulled
out a noisy chicken and a knife. &quot;Am I in a dungeon, or a
madhouse...&quot; muttered Tandar.</P>
<P CLASS="western">	&quot;I'll bite. What does a chicken have to do
with seeing the future?&quot; Tandar sighed. &quot;Your friend with
the turban asked for a fortuneteller, but he was not specific. I am a
poison oracle,&quot; pronounced Ombogi. &quot;I can see the future
through the trail of blood a poisoned creature leaves behind.&quot;
&quot;Good Gods, you must run out of chickens fast!&quot; &quot;My
ancestors did, but now we fix the chicken up with herbal cures. It
lets me master one chicken's motions in vivid detail, plus it makes
for better flavor when it eventually becomes dinner.&quot; &quot;Well,
we have two paths to pick, and &ndash;&quot; &quot;The left path is
safe, the right path leads to riches. I heard you mention this some
time ago so, I did the ritual then.&quot; &quot;Right path it is!&quot;
&quot;Also, the right path is likely to get one of us killed.&quot;</P>

<FONT FACE="Nyaal">	Tandar fretted nervously with his hat, unsure of
what to tell Sabharum and Tsuko. He decided to tell them the truth,
or at least part of it. &quot;Your fortuneteller wants us to go
right, there's more loot that way.&quot; &quot;How did he learn
this?&quot; Sabharum inquired, &quot;I do not know this Ombogi
fellow.&quot; &quot;He bled a chicken half to death then healed it
back up. Magic sure is wonderful...&quot; grumbled Tandar, as the
caravan wheeled behind them down the right path. As they passed down
the corridor, the dungeon became more and more featureless, with
blank, flat walls and the occasional open stone door. As they turned
a corner, Tandar and Tsuko stood agape at the mounds of silver coins,
and almost didn't notice the tall gray creature that floated on a
disc of light at the top of the room. &quot;INTRUDERS! </FONT><FONT FACE="Nyaal"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="hi-IN">&#4735;

squawked the creature in a foreign tongue, as it pulled out a glowing
device and pointed it at the group. &quot;He can't be that tough, can
h&ndash;&quot; Tandar's words stopped suddenly as a bolt of energy
shot out of the creature's device and turned the swashbuckler to ash.
Tsuko drew his katana and rushed at the assailant, while Sabharum
hailed a priest from the caravan to see if Tandar could be revived.
All signs pointed to no, but magic can be wonderful...</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western">	Dungeon Vanguards is a tabletop RPG set in a
fantasy world beset by massive, growing, slow-moving structures
called Crawling Dungeons. To prevent a Crawling Dungeon from
squashing a town, kingdoms send out teams of Vanguards into the
monstrosities with a caravan of supporting characters to halt the
evil from inside. Many of these characters would be seen as very
strange or oddly specific to people unfamiliar with this world, but a
baffling man who specializes in attacking with a cape or a magician
who specializes in reflecting magic back at enemy mages are common
sights here. And &quot;here&quot; is a broad term, because where you
enter a Crawling Dungeon is not the same place that you exit, and
people from around the globe mingle because they have been
transported from their home to foreign lands. Of course, many of
these people want to get back home, and the only way they know to do
that is to go into dungeons until one of the exits takes them to
their homeland. It should get easier once a Vanguard loots magical
items from dungeons, but that's only if he doesn't die in the
process. And those that aren't careful will die... But the dungeons
must be stopped.</P>

</SPAN>	In Dungeon Vanguards, your goal is to venture into perilous
moving structures and stop their rampage through the world. To
accomplish this, a player creates a character to scout ahead (a
Vanguard) and a character to support the team from the sidelines (a
Caravaner). When in town, there's the option to recruit other
characters for the Caravan. The Caravan is a magically fortified
wagon that is very difficult to enter without a key, and the
Caravaners are normally safe inside unless a Vanguard's key is taken.
If a player's Vanguard dies, however, one of the Caravaners must be
promoted to Vanguard for that player to keep playing. All characters
can do something in combat in this game, so even a Jeweler or
Cheesemaker can be of some use in a fight. Both combat and traps can
be dangerous, even lethal, to an unprepared character, so you need to
plan ahead and stay vigilant.
</P>
<P CLASS="western">	A character has 4 stats: Toughness, Agility,
Persona, and Expertise. They range from 1 to as high as 9 for very
powerful characters, and a new character has a maximum of 4 in any
one stat.</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">Toughness makes you do more and take less
	physical damage, and makes you harder to kill.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">Agility makes you hit more often and be hit
	less often for both weapon and magical attacks.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">Persona lets you inspire allies, intimidate
	enemies, resist magic, and ignore fear.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">Expertise lets you precaution allies, outwit
	enemies, cast magic, and see through trickery.</P>
</UL>
<P CLASS="western">	All of these effects are covered in the Actions
summaries below, except for magical actions, which are covered in the
Magic section.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Character Creation</H2>
<P CLASS="western">	Each major character (such as	To create a
character, assign 10 points across the four stats, with a maximum
number of 4 and a minimum of 1. You start with 25 HP (Health Points),
plus your Toughness. Then, you choose a Class from the list of 200.
This gives you several abilities, which are split into Passives,
Talents, and Items, each themselves split into Innate and Access.
Passives grant a constant numerical bonus to some actions you take,
Talents grant new choices for actions or have specialized effects on
other actions, and Items are what you carry with you into a dungeon,
including weapons, armor, equippable artifacts, magic potions, and
consumables like food.</P>
<P CLASS="western">	An Innate ability can be an Innate Passive or an
Innate Talent, and Innate Items are a bit different (not abilities,
but rather equipment you get for free). When you pick a Class, you
start with all the Innate Passives and Innate Talents your class
lists, at the listed Ranks. Read the effects of the Passive and
Talent for what the Rank does; higher Ranks are better. You start
each run through a Dungeon with all your Innate Items at the listed
Rank; though an Item can run out of uses (such as by drinking a
Potion), or be broken in a fight, Innate Items will be refreshed when
you can rest in a town.</P>
<P CLASS="western">	Access abilities are things your class lets you
learn, and Access Items are objects your class gives you the
connections to buy (via a guild). When you complete a Dungeon and
survive, then you can either increase the Rank of an existing Innate
Passive or Talent by 1 or add one of your class' Access Passives or
Access Talents as a new Rank 1 Innate ability. Your max HP also goes
up after completing a dungeon; add your Toughness again to your max
HP. You get a chance to buy Access Items before you go into a
dungeon. Each character starts with 400 gold, and can use this to
acquire things that his class lists as Access Items, as well as
whatever happens to be sold in town. This is covered in the Items
section. Occasionally, you can add to the Rank of the Access Items
you can acquire, or gain a new or better Innate Item. You do this by
selling treasure back to your guild. Mysterious sites within Crawling
Dungeons may grant the ability to increase a whole party's stats, but
these are rare and sought-after.</P>
<P CLASS="western">	Some characters can Cast spells, which are
treated differently from other actions. You learn a spell by taking a
Rank in a Magic Talent, such as Fire Magic or Fortune Magic, and many
classes start with multiple Magic Talents. Each spell you learn can
be cast once per encounter (a fight or a rest period between fights),
and then it's gone until the encounter ends. You can learn the same
spell more than once to let you cast it more times. Spells must be
cast as part of a Cast Challenge, which can take multiple turns and
can be interrupted. In exchange for their limited usage, most spells
are very potent.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Glossary of Terms</H2>
<UL>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">Action: Something a character does, like
	attacking or inspiring. You get two actions per turn; one standard
	and one talk action, with the option to convert either or both to
	minor actions.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">Adaptation: Your ability to figure out
	enemies' tricks and avoid being Outwitted. Your Adaptation starts
	with 10 + your Expertise and is improved by some Passives and items.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">Animal: A type of creature, Animals include
	both natural creatures and giant or modified versions of ordinary
	beasts. The kinds that can be encountered in dungeons are either
	Scavengers (like Dire Rats and Shadow Chimps) or Carnivores (like
	Wind Wolves and Velociraptors). All the Animals in Crawling Dungeons
	are highly aggressive, as if the Dungeon is driving them mad.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">Attack: An aggressive attempt to damage an
	opponent, which can be made with a weapon, bare hands, a natural
	weapon such as a monster's claws or fangs, or a spell. Attacking
	with anything but a spell is a physical attack, and is a standard
	action. Physical attacks involve a roll to hit vs. the opponent's
	Dodge, and thse that deal damage can have that damage Soaked.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">Barrier: Your ability to resist the effects
	of magic, including damage from spells. Your Barrier starts with 10
	+ your Persona and is improved by some Passives and items.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">Cast: Magic spells need to be Cast as part of
	a Cast Challenge. This involves making a roll or series of rolls to
	Cast, each as a standard action. Rolls start with 3d6 + your
	Expertise, and for the Challenge you add each roll's result to a
	total until that total meets or exceeds a Challenge Number for the
	spell (typically around 25, but some are much higher). Some
	Passives, some Items, and all Magic Talents improve your rolls to
	Cast.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">Celestial: A type of creature, Celestials
	come from the sky, and are believed to be angels. Not much is known
	about them, but there are many conflicting religions in the world,
	and while all of them recognize that an angel serves a god, since so
	many gods from various pantheons are evil, all reasonable churches
	have given permission to destroy Celestials that defend Crawling
	Dungeons.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">Class: Characters always have Classes, which
	cover both a character's physical and magical powers as well as his
	or her role in the world, as shown by the guilds that each class is
	associated with. Classes in Dungeon Vanguards are chosen from a list
	of 200, in the Classes section.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">Construct: A type of creature, Constructs are
	mobile machines, golems, animate objects, and other artifacts given
	a semblance of life. Constructs are typically resistant to both
	physical and magical damage, but are slow-moving and lack much
	intellect. Rumors persist of Celestial-built Constructs that are
	more intelligent than the brightest Human mages, but these have
	never been verified.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">Courage: Your ability to ignore fear effects
	and stay calm when foes Intimidate you. Your Courage starts with 10
	+ your Persona and is improved by some Passives and items.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">Creature: This is a general term for both
	people and monsters, and is used to differentiate these from
	inanimate objects and terrain features. Creatures at least have
	stats, and sometimes have Passives, Talents, or other abilities.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">Damage: Physical injury. Unlike some other
	fantasy games, damage is applied to Health Points rather than &quot;hit&quot;
	points, meaning you are actually physically harmed by attacks you
	fail to soak.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">Dodge: Your ability to avoid attacks, both
	physical and magical. Your Dodge starts with 10 + your Agility, and
	is improved by some Passives and equipment but made worse by weighty
	armor.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">Fiend: A type of creature, Fiends come from
	Hell or are descendants of things that invaded from Hell, and are
	always evil and sadistic. Most common religions are dedicated to
	stamping out Fiends from the world, but they have had little
	success. For some reason, both Fiends and Celestials (natural
	enemies) can be found within Crawling Dungeons, though they don't
	seem to cooperate.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">Humanoid: A type of creature, Humanoids are
	people that are Humans or are like Humans, including Elves, Dwarves,
	Goblins, and Orcs. Humanoids are defined by their class, and all
	adult Humanoids have a class. A Humanoid's species doesn't have any
	concrete gameplay effect, but a player can choose a species for his
	character that he thinks fits his character concept. In the game
	world, Dwarves tend to have high Toughness, Elves tend to have high
	Agility, and so on, but these are not absolute rules, and you can
	create (or encounter) a sickly Dwarf with Toughness 1.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">Mode: Weapons and some attack spells can have
	modes, which modify their effects in some way and may be optional or
	required (e.g. Poles have Reach mode as an option, but Bombs are
	Burst mode only). The modes are Stun (which simply knocks an enemy
	unconscious instead of killing them at 0 HP), Burst (which lets one
	attack hit multiple enemies, but also sometimes harms allies), and
	Reach (which lets you make a delayed attack that waits until you
	approach an enemy or until an enemy approaches you).</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">Ooze: A type of creature, Oozes are mindless
	(or at their best, very stupid) puddles of slime, acid, or elemental
	material. Mundane Oozes are usually slow-moving, hungry for living
	flesh, and very resistant to physical damage. Elemental Oozes may be
	quite different from their Mundane counterparts, and include
	everything from Mud Elementals to Nuclear Elementals.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">Passive: A Passive grants a constant
	numerical bonus to some actions you take in combat. Examples include
	Aggression, which increases the damage you deal, and Warded, which
	helps you avoid attack spells and lessens the power of harmful
	magic.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">Rank: Almost every part of a character has a
	Rank, including Passives, Talents, and Items. A Passive's Rank
	multiplies the bonus the Passive provides. Rank 1 in a Talent gives
	you a preliminary benefit, while additional Ranks make those
	benefits much stronger. Items are referred to as either Rank X or
	+X, and any Rank above 0 means the Item is enchanted, and provides
	specific bonuses. High-Ranked items also cost much more when
	purchased.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">Soak: Reduction of physical damage. A Soak
	roll starts with 3d6 + your Toughness. Soak rolls are improved by
	armor and by some Passives.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">Spell: A specific use of magic that must be
	Cast to work. A spell can be cast once per time you learned it, per
	encounter.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">Stats: The four stats, Toughness, Agility,
	Persona, and Expertise (abbreviated TAPE), define the core of who
	your character is. Most die rolls add one stat to the result and are
	opposed by something also modified by one stat.</P>
</UL>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always">Tactics Grid
System</H2>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="Dungeon%20Vanguards%20Book_html_27e437a0.gif" NAME="graphics111111" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=35% HEIGHT=29% BORDER=0>	Each
major character (such as a PC) or each group of minor characters
(such as a cluster of evil slimes) has a playing piece on a sheet of
paper called a tactics grid. The position of a character's piece on
the grid shows what kind of tactic they favor that round, and grants
bonuses and penalties for actions that relate to that tactic. There
may be multiple tactics grids on different sheets of paper if a fight
takes place in different zones (one zone represents a room or
hallway, usually), with each zone a separate grid, but characters can
move between zones/grids without difficulty. A tactics grid is a
3-by-3 set of boxes (much like the one used in Tic-Tac-Toe) with the
top, bottom, left, and right edges marked with different ways of
approaching combat. The tactics grid has three rows, the top one
marked Risk and representing reckless or risky tactics, the bottom
one marked Safety and representing stealthy or careful tactics, and
the middle one representing tactics that lie between the other two,
such as shooting from around a corner or blocking and parrying with a
sword. There are three columns, the left one marked Help and
representing supportive or leading tactics, the right one marked
Control and representing manipulative or frightening tactics, and the
center one representing tactics that avoid influence from enemies.</P>
<P CLASS="western">	 The GM describes what zones are present and what
they mean when a fight begins, and also states which zone the
Vanguards start in. The Caravan is its own zone, and though some
Caravaners may choose to start outside of their fortified vehicle, it
is time-consuming to enter or exit the Caravan during a fight. You
put a playing piece representing your character on any square in your
starting zone when combat begins, and don't move it until you take
your turn (you can change square on the same grid at the start of
each of your turns, but can't change which grid you are on without
spending an action). The position of your playing piece determines
what actions you get bonuses or penalties on and which actions have
bonuses or penalties when used against you. If a fight has more than
one zone, you can spend a minor action (giving up your talk or
standard action that turn) to move your playing piece to any box on
any grid.  Movement is important because you need to be on the same
grid as your target to attack in melee, but ranged attacks are more
difficult to make against enemies on the same grid. Some actions are
affected by row (whether a piece is closer to Risk or Safety), while
others are affected by column (how close a piece is to Help or
Control).</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Appeal Grid System</H2>
<P CLASS="western">	The same sheet of paper used for the tactics grid
can also be used for social encounters, adapting the kinds of tactics
in combat to the kinds of appeal that can be made in a discussion.
This means that you place a playing piece on the grid to say whether
you are trying to get someone to take a Risk, seek Safety or do
something that falls in the middle ground. The piece's position also
explains the reason you give them to do this, such as to Help others,
to Control others, or somewhere in-between. In an encounter with a
group of young goblins breaking windows, you could appeal to the
rowdy vandals' Risk (implying a reward for going into danger) to get
them to start a riot elsewhere and let you avoid a fight, or whether
you choose to appeal to the hungry kids' desire for Safety and buy
them food, so that you can start a dialogue with them and get the lay
of the land. At the same time, you can describe another aspect to
your Appeal. In a talk with a constable, this other aspect could be
whether you are trying to appeal to the officer's desire to Help
people, or his desire to be in Control and have power. Like with Risk
and Safety, every individual will react to different Appeals
differently. A pompous officer in an authoritarian empire will
probably not try to Help citizens if asked, but will care about his
Safety and his level of Control. On the other hand, a policeman in a
small, sleepy village may want to Help citizens, but he could be too
humble to desire Control over others, and might even take an Appeal
to Control as an insult. There are too many kinds of appeal to cover
on a 3x3 grid, so each of the four Appeals actually covers a wider
scope than the name implies on its own.</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">Risk covers all kinds of self-destructive
	behavior, whether this is someone getting into a fight, or a
	criminal turning himself into police (which is almost always the top
	left box, Help/Risk, because doing something that harms yourself
	falls under Risk even if it helps people).</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">Safety covers all kinds of personal comfort,
	such as wealth, companionship, material possessions, and of course
	freedom from danger. Seducing or bribing someone is an appeal to
	Safety.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">Help covers obeying reason, loyalty, and
	&quot;doing the right thing&quot;, but from the perspective of the
	NPC being convinced. &quot;Help&quot; for an evil orc means helping
	others in his group, not anyone else.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">Control covers negative emotions that may or
	may not be self-destructive; telling someone to go scare some
	theives out of town is an appeal to Risk and Control (top right),
	but telling a mob boss, &quot;I'll do anything,&quot; to survive is
	an Appeal to Safety and Control (bottom right), where the control is
	over you.</P>
</UL>
<P CLASS="western">	In a social encounter, an NPC needs a certain
Persuasion Number(PN) to do what you want, raised by Appeals made of
the right kind and reduced by Appeals of the wrong kind. Put a
playing piece on the Appeals Grid to show what you are Appealing to
that round, and put a counter down on that box when the round ends.
Good role-playing may count as a good Appeal if the GM thinks it
fits. The GM tracks the progress toward the PN, but you fail a social
encounter if you use the wrong kinds of appeals too often, and this
may start a fight or force the PCs to find another path.  NPCs will
often have transitions where if a particular Appeal is used or
something is mentioned, their behavior changes, like repeating a
deceased friend's wishes to cause someone to rethink his life. An
example might be: Jim the Border Guard, PN 4 succeeds (lets you
cross), -3 PN fails (attacks), Safety +1, Help +1, Risk -1. Giving a
bribe ends in success unless Jim has negative PN, then it ends in
failure. Failing to give a legal, reasonable answer for why you want
to pass causes a transition: PN 5 succeeds, -2 PN fails, Safety +1,
Control +1, Risk -2. Bribes are still effective post-transition, but
cost more.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Actions</H2>
<UL>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">(Standard) Attack: You attack an enemy using
	a weapon at hand. If you are using a melee weapon, choose an enemy

<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always">Passives</H2>
<P CLASS="western">	A Passive is an ability that provides a simple
boost to die rolls on specific actions or a flat bonus to a number
value that determines part of your character. For example, Finesse
gives a bonus on all rolls to hit, and Aggression increases the
damage you deal with all attacks. Some are more specialized, like
Sniper, which gives a bonus on rolls to hit and to the damage you
deal, but only with ranged attacks, and Alertness, which increases
your Dodge (how hard to hit you are) in the first round of combat. A
character has a rank in each of his Passives, ranging from 1 to 6,
that multiplies the effect of the Passive. The Glossary defines some

<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always">Basics of
Talents</H2>
<P CLASS="western">	A Talent is an ability a character has that is
more specialized than a Passive, or provides a new action the
character can take. Examples include Sword Mastery, which gives
significant bonuses when wielding a sword or sword-like weapon, Fiend
Bane, which gives a very large bonus to damage against Fiend monsters
and lets you make items from Fiends' corpses, and Counterattack,
which gives you a new action that puts you in a state where you
attack people who attack you. Many Talents are useful out of combat
as well, such as Maintenance, which restores damaged items to working
order while you aren't in combat, and Artifact Craft, which lets you
craft items in down-time and appraise the value and powers of items.
Your ability to use magic is determined in large part by your Magic
Talents, which are summarized here and described in detail in the
Magic section.</P>
<P CLASS="western">	A Talent grants a benefit at Rank 1, such as the
ability to mock enemies with Taunt or bonus damage vs. Animals and
the knowledge of how to butcher their corpse to make usable meat with
Animal Bane. Each talent grants a different benefit to you at each
additonal Rank after 1, usually an incremental increase to how
effective you are when using that Talent. Some talents need rolls to
perform; these rolls are usually improved with each Rank you take
after the first, as well as by a stat, i.e. Toughness, and often
having Ranks in a specific Passive will boost the roll to perform the
talent.</P>
<P CLASS="western">	To help navigate the large list, Talents can be
split into a few special categories of similar effects: Weapon
Mastery, Magic, Item Craft, and Creature Bane Talents.</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">The Weapon Mastery Talents are Axe Mastery,
	Blade Mastery, Bludgeon Mastery, Bomb Mastery, Bow Mastery, Gun
	Mastery, Knife Mastery, Spear Mastery, Spike Mastery, and Whip
	Mastery.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">The Magic Talents can be split into elemental
	magic and general magic.</P>
	<UL>
		<LI><P CLASS="western">The elemental Magic Talents are Atom Magic,
		Dark Magic, Earth Magic, Fire Magic, Ice Magic, Light Magic, Metal
		Magic, Poison Magic, Sound Magic, Storm Magic, Water Magic, and
		Wind Magic.</P>
		<LI><P CLASS="western">The general Magic Talents are Anathema
		Magic, Charm Magic, Dispel Magic, Fortune Magic, Guard Magic, Heal
		Magic, Hex Magic, Ritual Magic, and Time Magic.</P>

<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always">Basics of Items</H2>
<P CLASS="western">	Item is the general term for an object that has a
Rank from 0 to 6 and a category, which can be a Weapon, a piece of
Armor, a piece of Apparel, an equippable Artifact, a piece of Food,
and/or a Potion. Examples include a Shortsword, which is a Weapon, a
Suit, which is Apparel, and a Fish, which is both a Food and a
semi-viable Weapon (if you whack someone with it). An Item's
categories determine what Item Craft Talents apply to it, as well as
some additional effects. You equip Armor, Apparel, and Artifacts, and
only a few of these cannot be worn together; these are noted as
having a Slot (either Head, Body, One Hand, or Two Hands) in the
Item's description. You can hold one One-Handed item in each hand,
but you must choose only one of the two items to be wielding or using
at the start of each turn (but see the Flurry Talent for the benefits
of wielding two Weapons). Weapons have a further subcategory that
determines what kind of Weapon Mastery Talent applies to them, such
as Knife or Bow; a single weapon may have one or two subcategories. A
Knife is only in the Knife category, but a Flail is both a Bludgeon
and a Whip, for example. Other than Mastery Talents, there is no
&quot;level of proficiency&quot; needed to use an item; any
adventurer can use a Bow, Pistol, Heavy Armor, Katana, etc. with no
penalties.</P>
<P CLASS="western">	An Item's Rank represents its level of quality,
including magical enhancements. A commonplace item is Rank 0, while a
well-forged or magically-augmented item has a higher Rank, up to 6
for legendary Items. Rank 0 Items are commonly available on the open
market, but Items from Ranks 0 to 4 are typically available to
characters through their guilds, with higher Ranks becoming available
as a character's standing improves in a guild. All Items get better
at higher Rank, and Items other than Weapons rarely have any effect
if they are less than Rank 1. For each Rank above 0, an Item's Rank
Bonus goes up. Rank Bonuses have some numbers with an 'R' appended;
substitute this 'R' for the Item's Rank and multiply that number by
the Rank. For example, a Battleaxe has the Rank Bonus &quot;You gain
+2R on rolls to hit and deal +4R damage, but only with melee physical
attacks, and you lose -2R Dodge.&quot; At Rank 3, that Battleaxe
would provide you with +6 on rolls to hit (+2 times Rank 3) and would
deal +12 damage on your melee physical attacks (+4 times Rank 3), but
you would lose -6 Dodge (-2 times Rank 3). Because some items impose
penalties at higher Ranks (usually as a result of being larger and
heavier to be more effective at one thing), it may be a good idea to
avoid very-high-Ranked axes, guns, and heavier armors until you have
a well-rounded set of defenses.</P>
<P CLASS="western">	Your primary means of acquiring good items is
through your guild. Guilds have all sorts of ways to contact and be
contacted by members; this varies by class and character, but while a
Paladin would contact his guild through divine magic during his
morning prayers, a Hooligan (yes, they have a guild too, though it's
more of a fraternity) would go out drinking and find by sheer dumb
luck that he purchased a +3 Knife in a period of the prior night of
carousing he can't remember. You can make up whatever story for how
your character contacts his guild, as long as it only happens in
towns (otherwise you could have the entire guild show up in a
dungeon, and then things get ugly).</P>
<P CLASS="western">	You use gold to purchase Access Items from your
guild, as well as any Rank 0 Items you want on the open market. A
character starts with 400 gold at character creation, and can use
this to buy equipment from his Guild or the open market, or to pool
money to hire an extra Caravaner. An Item has a listed cost in gold
for a Rank 0 version of that Item; a Rank 1 Item costs 10 times what
the listed cost is, a Rank 2 Item costs 20 times, a Rank 3 costs 30
times and so on, up to a Rank 6 (if you can acquire one) costing 60
times the listed cost in gold. Items like Cloaks and Light Armor have
no benefit at Rank 0, but Weapons and Food do. Hiring a new Caravaner
NPC costs 500 gold, and most will immediately spend much of 400 gold
on starting equipment, investing or gambling with the rest (a common
bet is that the Caravaner will make it out of a Crawling Dungeon
alive, which typically has 2-1 odds against the Caravaner's survival;
collecting on the other gamblers may be difficult without long-range
magic because of how Crawling Dungeons transport adventurers). The
recruited Caravaner can become any player's Vanguard or Caravaner if
either of that player's current characters dies.</P>
<P CLASS="western">	Once an Item is purchased, it usually starts with
a set number of uses. Each of these Items has circumstances that
reduce its uses, such as attacking with a Bomb, rolling poorly and
missing with an attack with a Longsword, throwing one of the bladed
discs called Chakrams (but not attacking with one in melee), and
being hit hard by a weapon but rolling poorly to Soak the damage
while wearing Light Armor. A poor roll on an attack is an Attack
Fumble, and you get one Fumble per '1' on the dice if you miss. A
poor roll to Soak is a Soak Fumble, and you get one Fumble per '1' on
the dice if you take 10 or more damage after Soaking. A poor roll to
use magic is a Cast Fumble, and you get one Fumble per '1' on the
dice if you roll to Cast with an Item that affects such rolls and you
still get less than half the number needed for the Cast Challenge
(such as rolling a total of 14 or less to Cast Slumber, which has a
Challenge of 30). You can only Fumble (on any kind of roll) in combat
or other hazardous situations, such as falling into a trap. Some
Items never lose uses (such as most Artifacts) but others lose uses
every time they are thrown (using a throwing weapon for a ranged
attack) or every time they are used to attack. Some consumable Items
lose a use every time they are consumed in some way specific to the
Item, such as drinking a Potion, eating a slice of Cake, applying a
weapon to a Trapping Kit to make a trap, baiting a room or trap with
Cheese to lure out Giant Rats, or laying a trail with crumbs from
Bread. Drinking, eating, and applying are standard actions, baiting
takes a full round but is only effective out of combat, and laying a
trail is a free action that is also only effective out of combat. As
a special usage, some items rot if not consumed in the first Dungeon
after purchasing them (or if the item becomes cursed); this changes
the item's function to power up the Defile Talent (which curses enemy
Items, rendering them far less usable until purified with the Cleanse
Talent), and reduces the Item's uses to 1.</P>
<P CLASS="western">	Some Items have descriptors with their usage
circumstances. Durable usage means that any time the Item would lose
a use, it loses one less, to a minimum of 0. Flexible means whenever
the item is repaired, restoring its uses, it gains three times the
restoration, and can be repaired from a destroyed or used-up state as
if it were at -10 uses. Reload describes Weapons that carry
ammunition, such as Pistols and Crossbows, and can fire shots without
the gun or crossbow being used itself; you track uses from a
Reloadable Weapon as normal, but when you run out, you simply spend a
standard action to refill the Weapon's chambers (ammunition for life
is included in a Reloadable Weapon's cost).</P>
<P CLASS="western">	Weapons are considered either Melee, Ranged,
Thrown, or Magic, with Magic Staffs as the only Items that are both
Magic and Melee. Melee weapons can only be used in melee (against a
target in the same zone), ranged weapons target a character in any
zone but take a penalty when used in melee, throwing weapons can be
used in melee or thrown to make an attack into any zone one movement
step away (and are slightly weaker, relative to a melee or ranged
weapon), and magic weapons give a bonus to rolls to Cast, including
when used out of combat. All weapons have a modifier they apply on
rolls to hit, and melee, ranged, and thrown weapons have a base
amount damage they deal. Rolls to hit also consider your Agility and
several Passives, while damage considers your Toughness and other
Passives. Magic weapons modify your rolls to hit with attack spells
and also provide a bonus on Cast rolls. Weapons can have Modes, which
can be optional (the default if unspecified) or required. Stun Mode
lets you knock an enemy unconscious for several hours instead of
killing them when you reduce them to 0 HP (Construct and Ooze
monsters, as well as some Fiends such as Zombies, cannot be knocked
unconscious and take half damage instead from Stun Mode). Reach Mode
can only be used for melee attacks, but lets you ready an attack as a
standard action; this readied attack goes off immediately when you
enter a zone with an enemy in it or when an enemy enters the zone you
are in, but the readied attack cannot be used against an enemy
already in your zone. Only one attack can be readied at a time (for
as many rounds as you like in the same combat), and you can choose
which enemy to attack with the readied attack, including holding off
until another chance comes up. Burst Mode can be applied to Weapons
or some spells, and lets you attack everyone in a zone, friend or
foe, with a -4 penalty to hit.</P>
<P CLASS="western">	Some Items have special traits. This could mean
an Item could be used as bait for certain creatures, used to lay a
trail through a dungeon, could be easy to find in the wilderness
(such as Herbs of dubious quality), or could occupy a slot (meaning
you can't wear Heavy Armor on top of Light Armor on top of a Dress,
since each occupies the body slot). Some weapons have other special
traits, such as firearms that ignore the target's armor (making it so
they cannot use armor bonuses to Soak), axes that do additional
damage against unarmored targets, and Hammers that are more effective
against armored targets. Some monsters are considered to be wearing
armor due to their physical hardness, even if you can't take this
&quot;armor&quot; from them; this makes axes less effective against
such monsters and makes firearms more effective.</P>
<P CLASS="western">	Weapon subcategories are important mainly for the
purposes of Weapon Mastery Talents. The subcategories are Axe
(including thrown and chopping axes), Blade (a wide category of large
swords and other slashing weapons), Bludgeon (another wide category
of clubs, hammers, and other blunt instruments), Bomb (only including
explosives), Bow (including bows with arrows and crossbows), Gun
(only firearms), Knife (a narrow category of the common short
stabbing weapons), Spear (including throwing spears and polearms),
Spike (including spikes on shields and armor), and Whip (including
all flexible weapons). If your weapon has two subcategories and you
have both Weapon Mastery Talents for them, both can apply; the reroll
applies to the lowest two dice instead of the lowest die in that
case, and you gain both of the Talents' additional benefits.</P>
